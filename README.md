# 🧠 MNIST Classification with Random Forest

A clean and efficient implementation of a **Random Forest classifier** on the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset** (0–9), achieving **~97% accuracy**. Includes confusion matrix visualizations and utilities to explore True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative examples for any chosen digit.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Random Forest Classification** using `scikit-learn`
- 📊 **Confusion Matrix** plotted using `seaborn`
- 🔍 **Per-digit analysis** of:
  - True Positives (TP)
  - True Negatives (TN)
  - False Positives (FP)
  - False Negatives (FN)
- 📈 **~97% Accuracy** on the MNIST test set
- 💡 Designed for learning, demonstration, and explainability

2. CLONE AND RUN

⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/ASaha-os/ml-2.git
cd ml-2

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

🚀 How to Run
Run the Random Forest classification and visualize results:

jupyter notebook mnist.ipynb

---


🧠 Additional features:

Choose any digit (0–9)

Retrieve and visualize example images of:

True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted as digit X

True Negatives (TN): All other digits correctly not predicted as X

False Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted as X

False Negatives (FN): Digit X incorrectly predicted as something else
